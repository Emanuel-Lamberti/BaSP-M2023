During the 15-week journey, this challenge of creating a web platform that adapts to different devices from scratch will be carried out.
The challenge will consist of creating a web page for a gym, whose name is Mega Rocket S.A.

To carry out this challenge, knowledge will be implemented with different tools and languages â€‹â€‹to carry out this activity.
They are:
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS3</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>

## Week 01
During week 01 the landing page was made in Figma, and each of its Screenflows.

## Week 02
A new repository was created, and the website layout began, based on what was previously done in week 01.

## Week 03
Added a new folder with html file and its styles in css. 
In this week, the work was oriented towards giving it the style proposed in the landing of the first week, working on its classes and labels.

## Week 04
In this part of the project, new style files are added to make the web platform responsive designed to be enjoyed on different devices. The main ones to mention would be the following: iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.
