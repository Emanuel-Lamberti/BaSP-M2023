## Week 07

For this week, the possibility of adding more functionality to the website was raised.

For the Signup form and for the Login form, the following must be done:
In each form an HTTP request must be made using the Javascript Fetch method,
sending all the data loaded in the form. The request should only be executed if they pass
all form validations; if any field does not meet the validations, it should not be
make the request.
In the request, the form data must be sent as query-params, that is, for each
field a value is sent following the format:
<li>../login?name=juan&lastName=lopez&...</li>

After making the HTTP request with the form data, depending on the result of the
same, different alerts should be displayed.

The URL for each form request is:
<ul>
    <li>Login: https://api-rest-server.vercel.app/login</li>
    <li>Signup: https://api-rest-server.vercel.app/signup</li>
</ul>


The only user who can perform a successful login is:
<ul>
    <li>email: rose@radiumrocket.com</li>
    <li>password: BaSProfessional</li>
</ul>
