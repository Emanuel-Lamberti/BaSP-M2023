## Week 01
During week 01 the landing page was made in Figma, and each of its Screenflows.

## Week 02
A new repository was created, and the website layout began, based on what was previously done in week 01.

## Week 03
Added a new folder with html file and its styles in css. 
In this week, the work was oriented towards giving it the style proposed in the landing of the first week, working on its classes and labels.
